# hello-world

Hello reader!

Here is a list of languages i've worked with:
C, C++, C#, HTML 5, CSS, JavaScript, Php, Mysql, ASM, jQuery, ajax.

Here is a list of languages i like:
C++, Javascript and ASM (i see assembly as more of a challenge then annything, i know it can get frustrating if you're making a big program >:) )

Im code mostly for fun, but i also study it in university and i did previously in school.
That's all folks!
